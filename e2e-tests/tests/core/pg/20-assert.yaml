# XXX
# In order to do a non-declarative test that validates the state transition of a restart action we split the test assertions in 2 parts.
# In the test assertion 02 we assert that the cluster is stopped and in 03 we assert that the cluster is up and ready to use.
# The test steps are still declarative so no operation is executed in 03.
commands:
  # This check has been disabled until a bug in PG operator has been fixed.
  # PG operator does not pause a DB when a backup is running. PG operator shall
  # wait until the backup has finished and only then pause the DB, but in v2.3.0
  # this logic is broken.
  # - command: kubectl wait --for=jsonpath='{.status.status}'=initializing db/test-pg-cluster -n "${NAMESPACE}"
