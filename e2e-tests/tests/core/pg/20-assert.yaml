# XXX
# In order to do a non-declarative test that validates the state transition of a restart action we split the test assertions in 2 parts.
# In the test assertion 02 we assert that the cluster is stopped and in 03 we assert that the cluster is up and ready to use.
# The test steps are still declarative so no operation is executed in 03.
