# Everest Operator

## Status

**This project is in the tech preview state right now. Don't use it on production.**

## Getting started

### Deploy the Everest operator

The first step is to deploy the Everest operator. This can be done using `kubectl`:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/everest-operator/main/deploy/bundle.yaml
```

### Deploy the underlying DB engine operators

The Everest operator relies on underlying operators for deploying DB clusters of a given engine type.

#### Percona XtraDB Cluster

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/v1.11.0/deploy/bundle.yaml -n everest-operator-system
```

#### Percona Server for MongoDB

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/percona-server-mongodb-operator/v1.11.0/deploy/bundle.yaml -n everest-operator-system
```

## Submitting Bug Reports

If you find a bug in Percona Monitoring and Management  or one of the related projects, you can submit a report to that project's [JIRA](https://jira.percona.com) issue tracker. Some of the related projects also have GitHub Issues enabled, so you can also submit there.

Your first step should be [to search](https://jira.percona.com/issues/?jql=project=PMM) the existing set of open tickets for a similar report. If you find that someone else has already reported your problem, then you can upvote that report to increase its visibility.

If there is no existing report, submit a report following these steps:

1. [Sign in to Percona JIRA.](https://jira.percona.com/login.jsp) You will need to create an account if you do not have one.
2. [Go to the Create Issue screen and select the relevant project.](https://jira.percona.com/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=11600&issuetype=1&priority=3)
3. Fill in the fields of Summary, Description, Steps To Reproduce, and Affects Version to the best you can. If the bug corresponds to a crash, attach the stack trace from the logs.

An excellent resource is [Elika Etemad's article on filing good bug reports.](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/talks/filing-good-bugs/).

As a general rule of thumb, please try to create bug reports that are:

- *Reproducible.* Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- *Specific.* Include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
- *Unique.* Do not duplicate existing tickets.
