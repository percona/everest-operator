# Percona Everest Operator

Percona Everest Operator is one of the core components of [Percona Everest](https://github.com/percona/everest), an open source cloud-native database platform that helps developers deploy code faster, scale deployments rapidly, and reduce database administration overhead while regaining control over their data, database configuration, and DBaaS costs.

Percona Everest Operator is a Kubernetes Operator responsible for managing the lifecycle of MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL databases. It leverages Percona's Kubernetes Operators for [MySQL](https://github.com/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator), [MongoDB](https://github.com/percona/percona-server-mongodb-operator), and [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/percona/percona-postgresql-operator/) under the hood but provides a unified API and a single pane of glass for managing all three database types.
