  # FIXME The current upgrade from PGO 2.3.1 to 2.4.1 has a bug that causes this step to fail so we have it commented but when we integrate with PGO 2.5.0 we can uncomment it.
  ## I know it's weird to use a TestStep to do an assertion but this is a
  ## particular case. We want to ensure that the cluster wasn't restarted. To do
  ## so, we wait for 30s for the state to change to initializing. If the state
  ## changes to initializing, kubectl returns immediately without errors and
  ## the test fails. On the other hand, if the state doesn't change, kubectl
  ## times out and the test passes.
