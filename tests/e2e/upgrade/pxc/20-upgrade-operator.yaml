  # I know it's weird to use a TestStep to do an assertion but this is a
  # particular case. We want to ensure that the cluster wasn't restarted. To do
  # so, we wait for 30s for the state to change to initializing. If the state
  # changes to initializing, kubectl returns immediately without errors and
  # the test fails. On the other hand, if the state doesn't change, kubectl
  # times out and the test passes.
